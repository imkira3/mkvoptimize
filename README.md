# mkvoptimize
The mkvoptimize Toolkit is a set of video opttimisation scripts that aims at optimizing all video, audio and subtitle streams in a video file to save space with a minimum of quality loss in the video stream, to convert audio to stereo (optional), and to convert text subtitles to a stripped form of SSA that gives your video player full font control.

Please be patient while I upload files and finish this readme, I still have some files to upload in the Assets folder but they are bigger than I can upload without a client. Please be patient.
