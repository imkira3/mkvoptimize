mkvoptimize buglist
-------------------------

Font tracks dropped if video and audio don't exist (font files can't be dropped into an otherwise empty VAF.mkv)
The cover.jpg file is detected as a video track (ffmpeg bug)
No support for secondary video tracks (Because cover.jpg is detected as a video track)
No support for data tracks in .TS files (Looks complicated, maybe later)
No support for SWF videos (I'll have to learn how to make my code tell the difference between SWF videos and interactive SWF files)
No support for drag-and-drop of multiple files (due to the nature of the loop I'll have to handle this part externally, should be doable)
